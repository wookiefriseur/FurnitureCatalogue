# Furniture Crafter's best friend\*

<sup>\*Actually not. The AddOn is pretty indifferent towards humans. Don't take it personal.</sup>

### DependsOn

- [LibCustomMenu](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1146-LibCustomMenu.html)
- [LibAddonMenu-2.0](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info7-LibAddonMenu-2.0.html)
- [LibAsync](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info2125-LibAsync.html)
- Optional:
     - [Furniture Shopping List \(FurC 2.0 patch\)](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1865-FurnitureShoppingListFurC2.0patch.html)
     - [LibDebugLogger](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info2275-LibDebugLogger.html)

You will find the latest dependencies in your local FurnitureCatalogue.txt and on [GitHub](https://github.com/manavortex/FurnitureCatalogue/blob/master/FurnitureCatalogue.txt#L7C1-L8C52).

### Missing/Incorrect entries

If you are here because you want to report an error in the data, please check [here](https://www.esoui.com/portal.php?&id=177&pageid=63) on how to get item links.
Feel free to send us a message (here or in game) with the item info for timely updates!

## Features:

### Check the [screenshots](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1617-FurnitureCatalogue.html#info)!

- **User-Interface**: _toggleable either via **keybind** or via **slash command** /fur_
- [FurnitureShoppingList](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1865-FurnitureShoppingListFurC2.0patch.html): Fully integrated
- **Compact/Full view**: Check the +/- button
- **Item database**: Holds a list of all available furniture blueprints (source: manavortex datamined most of them! `^_^`)
- **Filters**: All filters can be combined - check first screenshot
  - crafting station
  - crafting knowledge
  - item source
  - quality
  - game version
  - item name
- **Post to chat** Print the recipe (if known) or the material list to chat from an item link or the Interface - see second screenshot
- **Responsive developer** Found something that's not in the catalogue? Tell us where you got it, send an item link, and in it goes!

## Not possible:

- Preview: can't let you preview things from Furniture Catalogue. Scroll down for the long explanation
- Crown Store: can't access Crown Store tooltips. If you have a crown store item, please send us the link and price!

## Why should I use this instead of CraftStore?

> **_manavortex:_**
> You probably shouldn't - this AddOn has a different purpose. I wrote FurnitureCatalogue to help me with furnishing my homes - I wanted to know **what's out there** and **how I can get it**.

## Donations welcome!

> **_manavortex:_**
> Writing this AddOn was **a lot** of work. Almost all the included data files are generated by hand. I have literally spent hours just standing in front of furniture merchants, checking item conditions and putting things into files. _(If you want a better impression, check data/AchievementVendors.lua - I have visited every single one of those myself.)_
>
> By careful estimate I've spent 30+ hours on FurC since Morrowind hit PTS - the initial release ate a week of vacation turned to pretty much nonstop coding.

**_BerylBones_ has taken over updating since manavortex no longer plays ESO, so if you want to give back, feel free to donate to @berylbones, both on NA and EU!**

## Possible issues

### My crafter's knowledge isn't correct!

Just click the refresh button. If you want the AddOn to scan on every load, there is a setting "enable initial scan" - check if it's deactivated.

### This only shows Pact PVP furniture, and I'm $other_faction!

This is a **feature**. Adding complexity adds bugs and loading times - and that's needlessly complex, since the prices and item sources are the same.

### Something else is broken!

1. Disable AddOns that overwrite ESO functions or libraries (like **Shissu's Guild Tools**)
2. Reset the furniture catalogue database by middle-clicking the refresh button
3. Wipe the saved variables - you can do that from the AddOn menu via "Reset to default".
4. Do a clean install of the AddOn to make sure no outdated files are left
5. Get in touch with us with a description of the bug, [in the forums](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1617-FurnitureCatalogue.html#comments) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/manavortex/FurnitureCatalogue/issues):
   - Where exactly does it occur? (FurnitureCatalogue window, when right-clicking an item link...)
   - What is affected? (item links, posting to chat, exporting...)
   - What do we have to do to reproduce this bug?

<sup> Big thanks to our fellow developers for being so awesome and helping us out so much!</sup>

## The long version about the preview

> **_manavortex:_**
> I have talked to Chip Hilseberg (may his code never bug) about this, and he was quite clear - ZOS doesn't want us to preview items from the item links because of datamining etc. A function to preview items that we can craft may come eventually, but that will only help you while logged in on your crafter.
>
> Why can't you make it work like FurniturePreview?
> There is an API function that lets you preview something that is in a bag (a vendor is a bag too) or a guild store. In theory I could add preview functions from Furniture Catalogue for items that are in your inventory, but that would require yet another loop and have a negative impact on performance. (Again.) Just use FurniturePreview for those, please.
